An interactive tictactoe game on the command line. Written in go.

## Game Details
 - You get to decide how many human players there will be: 0, 1, or 2. The remaining players will be computer players.
 - A random coin flip will decide who goes first.
 - When asked for input, you will type in the location on the board you wish to play.
 - See the example board for valid input corresponding to a location:

```bash
	-----A----B----C--
	 1 | 1A | 1B | 1C |
	 2 | 2A | 2B | 2C |
	 3 | 3A | 3B | 3C |
	-------------------
```
- You can play more than once but if you wish to change the # of human players vs computer players, the program needs to be restarted.

## Run the program / Play tictactoe
```bash
go run tictactoe.go
```

## Further development
The file 'tmp.txt' holds todos and 'nice to haves' for improving this program. It is currently in a polished working state and all code can always be improved upon (: . Also open to suggestions and ideas!
