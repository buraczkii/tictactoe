## TODO list, major planning

 - keep track of players within the tboard struct
 - using user input, create 2 players that are users or computers
 - allow user input to mark the board




### nice to haves
 - keep track of positions and rows using maps, getting rid of all switch case statements
 - pretty print the result of the game: wins of player 1 vs player 2, ties
