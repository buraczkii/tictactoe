## TODO list /planning

 - tally scores
 - ask user their name
 - improve prompts: note when computer has gone, tell user when it's their turn & whose turn it is, 
 - add validation for user input
 - For additional games, if there was a winner, let them start. If a tie, then flip a coin


## nice to haves
 - keep track of positions and rows using maps, get rid of switch cases
 - pretty print the results of the game: players names & wins, ties, maybe even chronological: Game 1: Tie, Game2: User1 Wins 
 - see if you can refactor the code
 - write unit tests?
