## TODO list /planning
 - tally scores
 - add validation for user input
 - For additional games, if there was a winner, let them start. If a tie, then flip a coin
 - allow users to type in a lowercase like 2b


## nice to haves
 - keep track of positions and rows using maps, get rid of switch cases
 - pretty print the results of the game: players names & wins, ties, maybe even chronological: Game 1: Tie, Game2: User1 Wins 
 - see if you can refactor the code
 - write unit tests? 
 - can you just update the board? like in place in the terminal? that would be cool
    - "\r" is a carriage return but just returns to the previous line so i dont think it would entirely help with multi-line output
